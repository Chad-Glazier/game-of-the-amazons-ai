# Running the Project

(*The project doesn't run right now.*)

# Guidelines for Making Contributions

(*This section is for group members.*)

The following are a list of rules for contributing to the project when making any significant changes (i.e. anything other than a minor bug fix or change to documentation):
1) Open an issue (you can do that from [here](https://github.com/Chad-Glazier/game-of-the-amazons-ai/issues)).
1) Create a new branch for the issue (i.e. go to the issue page, and click on the "create a branch" link).
2) Make changes to the branch.
3) Submit a pull request to merge the branch to `main`.
4) Wait for another group member to review the changes and merge the changes. Once the PR is merged, the issue should automatically be marked as closed.

## Unit Tests

We are using the [JUnit](https://junit.org/) testing framework.

You can add unit tests to the [test folder](src/test/java/ubc/cosc322/), and then execute them with:

```sh
mvn test
```

The file structure of the test folder should mirror the main folder, and tests for a given class `ClassName` should be put in a class named `ClassNameTest`. See [BitBoardTest](src/test/java/ubc/cosc322/util/BitBoardTest.java) for a simple example.

## Dependencies 

This project depends on the following packages:
- [Junit](https://docs.junit.org/5.10.5/user-guide/), which is used for creating the unit tests [here](src/test/java/ubc/cosc322/).
