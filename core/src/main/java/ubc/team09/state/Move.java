/**
 * This class is used to handle moves on the board. Use this class to encode
 * or decode moves as <code>int</code>s and check their validity.
 * <hr />
 * The section below describes how moves are encoded as <code>int</code>s, but
 * you don't need to understand those details to use the class.
 * <br />
 * <br />
 * <strong>Representation of Moves</strong>
 * <br />
 * <br />
 * A move can be represented with three values:
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>The position of the queen we want to move,</li>
 * 	<li>The queen's new position, and</li>
 * 	<li>The position of the queen's arrow.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <br />
 * Since these are all position indices, they can be represented by something
 * as small as a <code>byte</code>. To ensure we have the convenience of using
 * primitive values, we will represent these three values with a single
 * <code>int</code>, where the bits are used like so:
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>The first (least significant) 8 bits are the starting position of the
 * queen.</li>
 * 	<li>The next 8 bits are the queen's destination.</li>
 * 	<li>The next 8 bits are the target for the queen's arrow.</li>
 * 	<li>The remaining (most significant) 8 bits indicate which player made the
 * move. This could be deduced from other board state information (i.e.,
 * checking which queen position array the starting position belongs to),
 * but we're not using these bits for anything else so we might as well
 * store the player color for convenience.</li>
 * </ul>
