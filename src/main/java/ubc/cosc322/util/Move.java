/**
 * This class is used to handle moves on the board. Use this class to:<br />
 * - encode moves as <code>int</code>s,<br />
 * - compute the board state after a move is made, and<br />
 * - generate possible moves.<br />
 * <br /><br />
 * The section below describes how moves are encoded as <code>int</code>s, but
 * you don't need to understand those details to use the class.
 * <br /><br />
 * <strong>Representation of Moves</strong>
 * <br /><br />
 * A move can be represented with three values:<br />
 * - The position of the queen we want to move,<br />
 * - The queen's new position, and<br />
 * - The position of the queen's arrow.<br />
 * <br /><br />
 * Since these are all position indices, they can be represented by something
 * as small as a <code>byte</code>. To ensure we have the convenience of using
 * primitive values, we will represent these three values with a single 
 * <code>int</code>, where the bits are used like so:<br />
 * - The first (least significant) 8 bits are the starting position of the 
 * queen.<br />
 * - The next 8 bits are the queen's destination.<br />
 * - The next 8 bits are the target for the queen's arrow.<br />
 * - The remaining (most significant) 8 bits are left empty.<br />
