/**
 * A bitboard is a means of representing a board such that each square 
 * is represented by a single bit. This obviously only allows for binary state,
 * but multiple bitboards can be used to represent more nuanced board data.
 * E.g., you could have one bitboard that flags all queens, one that flags all
 * arrows, etc. 
 * <br /><br />
 * Apart from the obvious point of saving memory, bitboards can also take
 * advantage of bitwise operators to perform certain actions much faster than
 * could be done with a more intuitive memory representation.
 * <br /><br />
 * Since bitboards are meant to be performant, this class is not meant to
 * wrap a bitboard with a neat interface (and thereby discard a ton of
 * performance gain); instead, it simply consists of a number of static utility
 * functions useful for creating and interacting with bitboards.
